# Kazi Anwar's Portfolio

Welcome to my dynamic personal portfolio website! Built using React.js, this site showcases my skills, open-source projects, work experience, certifications, blogs, and education. Integrated with the GitHub API for real-time project updates and customized theming options. Leveraged technologies such as GraphQL, Apollo Boost, BaseUI, React Reveal, and Styled Components. Additionally, projects and open-source pages are integrated with Google Analytics via a G-tag for analytics insights. The site is being deployed on GitHub pages from the master branch, separate from the main branch to avoid potential merge conflicts. After doing `npm run build` the build folder was pushed onto this branch instead of pushing all the base code onto the repo.
